## Filtering Columns and Rows

With SQL, you can filter columns and rows by using SELECT and WHERE. Here's an example using the Lahman database. First, load the database, along with the package sqldf.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```

If I wanted to see total homeruns for the 1927 Yankees, I could write the following query:

```{r}
query<-"select playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)

```
